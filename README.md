<h1>Image Classification</h1>
This Repo holds the code for a CNN model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) which consists of 60,000 color images across 10 unique classes which are equally distributed.</br></br>
The project demonstrates the inherent importance of using dropout layers and data augmentation to improve model accuracy for small datasets.
